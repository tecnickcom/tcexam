TCExam - GENERAL UPGRADE PROCESS
============================================================
This is the general upgrade process for TCExam.

If the new main version number is different than your 
installed main version number, please read the other guides 
below.

------------------------------------------------------------

0. No changes are required to the database. Anyway it's 
safer to make a database backup using your favourite 
database management application. 
 
1. Rename the current TCExam folder (eg: from 
/var/www/tcexam to /var/www/tcexam.old).  
 
2. Extract the new TCExam version to the same folder where 
it was previously installed (eg: /var/www/tcexam).  
 
3. Delete the tcexam/install folder.  
 
4. Manually edit all configuration files (check the values 
of previous installation). The configuration files are 
located on the following folders:
admin/config/  
public/config/  
shared/config/ 
 
5. Copy the multimedia content (images etc.) from your old 
cache folder to the new cache folder. 
 
6. Set the right files permissions to work with your 
WebServer/PHP environment; some folders must be writeable by
the Web user:  
admin/log  
public/log  
cache  
 
7. If you are using custom language files, replace the 
shared/config/lang/language_tmx.xml and delete the PHP files
on cache folder.  
 
8. Check if TCExam is working fine.  
 
9. Backup and delete the old TCExam installation 
(tcexam.old).

------------------------------------------------------------

TCExam - UPGRADE FROM VERSION 3 to 4
============================================================

TCExam 4 has a new database schema and other improvements 
that requires a new installation.

To import your questions and users database from version 3 
to 4, try the following:

1. Backup you entire existing database data (this is not 
   necessary for upgrading but it's a good thing to do).

2. Use the phpPgAdmin or phpMyAdmin application to export 
   the following tables from the old database in SQL format:
   
   tce_subjects
   tce_questions
   tce_answers
   tce_users 
   	(remove "admin" and "anonymous" users from this dump 
   	because they will be recreated)
   
   Note that on tce_users table the user_group_id field has 
   been removed and the user_verifycode field has been 
   introduced. So, when exporting this table exclude the 
   user_group_id field and use complete SQL inserts.
   Users' groups must be created manually from TCExam 
   interface.

3. Install TCExam 4 on a new directory and with a new 
   database name.
   
4. Use a DBMS manager application (pgAdmin3, phpPgAdmin, 
   phpMyAdmin, ...) to import the SQL previously saved.
   
5. If you are using the PostgreSQL database please update 
   also the sequences for the imported data.
