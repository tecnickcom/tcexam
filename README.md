## Description

TCExam is a software solution (CBA - Computer-Based Assessment) to
drastically simplify the evaluation process for schools, universities,
recruiting firms as well as private and public companies, allowing
professors, teachers and examiners to create, distribute and manage exams,
tests, surveys and quizzes.

Compared to the traditional Pen-and-Paper Testing (PPT), TCExam simplifies
the whole process of evaluation reducing costs and improving quality and
reliability of the examinations.

TCExam comes in a variety of languages and is already used all over the
world by top universities, schools, private and public institutions,
independent educators and research centers.

### KEY FEATURES

* **Flexibility and Configurability**: The system has been designed to offer a
high degree of adaptability to cover a great variety of usage scenarios.
Numerous configuration features allow customizing TCExam to fit all possible
requirements.

* **Free Open Source Software (FOSS)**: TCExam software is distributed with
GNU-AGPLv3 license. Open Source promotes Software reliability and quality by
supporting independent peer review and rapid evolution of the source code.

* **Web-based Architecture**: TCExam is Web-based and developed with LAMP
(Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) technology. User-friendly interface allows you
to install and use TCExam by simply connecting one cable to the switch of
your computer networks. All the computers on the network will be able to use
TCExam independently from the clientâ€™s operating system as a normal intranet
website, with no need to install any additional software or plug-in.

* **Internationalization (I18N)**: TCExam is language-independent through the
adoption of the UTF-8, Unicode and TMX standards. It supports the
Right-To-Left mode and currently includes translations in 25 different
languages.

* **Accessibility and Usability**: TCExam Web interface conforms to the XHTML
1.0 Strict standard, the guidelines on Accessibility (W3C-WAI-WCAG 1.0) and
Usability, to provide equal access and equal opportunity to people with
disabilities, including blindness.

* **Results and Statistics**: TCExam outputs a variety of result pages, enabling
various selection filters and providing numerous statistical indexes.
Results and statistics can then be exported into various formats for filing
or reworking. The test-takers can immediately be informed of the result of
their test, or have it delivered via email.

* **Data Import and Export**: TCExam uses Open Standard protocols for data
filing and interchange: TSV, XML and PDF. Everything is fully documented to
be easily extended or used by external applications. Custom filters can be
added to import data from other systems. Include Optical Mark Recognition
(OMR) system to import users' answers from paper sheets. TCExam supports
several types of remote authentication and single-sign-on protocols: LDAP,
RADIUS, CAS.

* **Multimedia Content**: TCExam uses a common mark-up language to add text
formatting, images, multimedia objects (audio and video) and mathematical
formulas (supports LaTeX and MathML).

* **Unique Tests**: TCExam can simultaneously generate unique tests for
different users by randomly selecting and sorting questions and alternative
answers. This feature drastically reduces or eliminates the chances of
cheating on the test.

* **Paper Testing with Optical Character Recognition (OMR)**: TCExam can
generate printable PDF documents for pen-and-paper testing. The OMR answer
sheet can be scanned and uploaded to TCExam for automatic test importing,
scoring and reporting.
